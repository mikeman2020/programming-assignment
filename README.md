All code for the assignment goes into this repository: programming-assignment
the main code files will be in "master branch"

when testing/adding new stuff the the code, create a branch.
This basically makes a copy of the original code which you can mess around with

When you are happy with the changes, you can then "commit".
This will bring all of the changes to the main branch.

Also, I've mainly been using Eclipse.
